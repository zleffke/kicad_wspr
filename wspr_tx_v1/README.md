# kicad_wspr_tx_v1
Basically an Si5351 breakout board with Low Pass Filters between all three clock outputs and the SMA connectors.

Taken from [Adafruit Si5351 Breakout EagleCAD design](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Si5351A-Clock-Generator-Breakout-PCB) but ported to KiCAD and LPFs added.

This version was designed but not actually built - 2020424
