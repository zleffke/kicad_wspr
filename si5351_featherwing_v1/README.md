# si5351_featherwing_v1
* Si5351 breakout board in Adafruit Feather form factor.
* Basically an Si5351 breakout board with Low Pass Filters between clk0 and clk1 and the SMA connectors. 
* LPFs are bypassable if external filtering is used.
* This specific version was designed to work with an [Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2796) with reference to pinouts, interrupts, etc.  May be applicable to other feathers, but the M0 Adalogger was the primary focus.
* The current version of the design also expects an Ultimate GPS featherwing (for timing alignment).
